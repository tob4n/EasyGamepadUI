### General outline:

Visual:
* Material design with no theming. Nobody cares about theming if the UI looks good by default.
* Users specify the categories in the menu and what will be in them.
* User can specify colors/style for menu items.

Functional:
* Differs from other frontends by not focusing exlusively on emulation.
* Can automatically display games from Steam/GOG and launch them with the proper flags.
* Can be configured to automatically display other games/apps by configuring paths.
* Proper integration with gamescope and Steam big picture launching.
